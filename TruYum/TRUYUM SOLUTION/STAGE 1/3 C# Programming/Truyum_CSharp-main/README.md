In this project we are building a food delivery app using only C#, now i know you came heree to just copy the codes and paste i so that you can be a real programmer, but 
no you are not :-D , I know you will copy this and show your friends that yaaaa!!!! i did it but let's cut this crap and get back to how you can do,

So, I have attached a database snaps on how the database should be or i would have just upload the database codes also, god knows what i will do , but however make the database on the information i would give you.
Now do remember that you change the connection string in the console folder--> app.config.

Now as i am very humble below is the link to the google drive where you can find the code full, again if github does some shit and prevents you from downloading, 
and because i couldn't upload the package file here, and i know you people won't be able to download that also
